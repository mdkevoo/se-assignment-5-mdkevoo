3. User Interface Overview:
   - Explain the main components of the VS Code user interface. Identify and describe the purpose of the Activity Bar, Side Bar, Editor Group, and Status Bar.

   >Main components of the Vs code user interface are
   1. Activity bar-Located on the far left-hand side. Lets you switch between views and gives you additional context-specific indicators, like the number of outgoing changes when Git is enabled. You can change the position of the Activity Bar.

   2. side bar-Contains different views like the Explorer to assist you while working on your project. side bar shows views such as the File Explorer, Search, and Source Control on the left of the workbench.
   we have primary and secondary side bars.
   
   3. Editor group-The main area to edit your files. You can open as many editors as you like side by side vertically and horizontally.By default, the editor region displays useful features such as the minimap, breadcrumbs, editor tabs, and has optional UI such as Sticky Scroll. You can also adjust the layout of the editors themselves or move them into floating windows.

   4. Status bar- Information about the opened project and the files you edit.

4. Command Palette:
   - What is the Command Palette in VS Code, and how can it be accessed? Provide examples of common tasks that can be performed using the Command Palette.
   Common palette is the place where all commands are found.  It's important that your command names are labeled appropriately so users can easily find them. How to access command palette is by he most important key combination to know is **Ctrl+Shift+P**, which brings up the Command Palette. From here, you have access to all functionality within VS Code, including keyboard shortcuts for the most common operations. The Command Palette provides access to many commands.Some of the commands are as follows

  **Ctrl+P** enables you to navigate to any file or symbol by typing its name
  **Ctrl+Tab** cycles you through the last set of files opened
  **Ctrl+Shift+P** brings you directly to the editor commands
  **Ctrl+Shift+O** enables you to navigate to a specific symbol in a file
  **Ctrl+G enables** you to navigate to a specific line in a file

5. Extensions in VS Code:
   - Discuss the role of extensions in VS Code. How can users find, install, and manage extensions? Provide examples of essential extensions for web development.

   The role of extension in visual code studio is to let you add languages, debuggers, and tools to your installation to support your development workflow, however extension authors plug directly into a vs code UI and contribute functionality through the same APIs used by VS code.

   User can find, install and manage extension for web development in visual code studio by navigating through extension icon in activity bar, inside extension icon you can search for various web development extensions. Essential web development extensions are as follows:-

   (a)**Web Dev**-This extension is a combination multiple extensions required for web development. This extension includes some of the major extensions like, Live Server, ESLint, and JavaScript (ES6) Code Snippets. Instead of installing these extensions individually we can install Web Dev extension.

   (b)**Live Share**-This extension enables real-time collaboration among developers. You can share your code with colleagues, allowing them to view, edit, and debug your code directly within their own Visual Studio Code environment. It’s a valuable tool for teams looking to enhance productivity and streamline the development process by enabling seamless code collaboration.

   (c)**Docker**- This is an essential tool for developers working with containerized apps. It streamlines the Docker container management process directly within the VS Code environment. This extension provides features like creating, managing, and debugging Docker containers and images. It also offers support for Docker Compose, making it simple to define and run multi-container apps.

   (d)**HTML CSS Support**-This extension provides autocompletion and suggestions for HTML and CSS code directly within the editor, which can significantly speed up coding and reduce errors. It offers features like class and ID attribute autocompletion, quick navigation to CSS definitions, and inline style support.

   (e)**Bracket Pair Colorizer**-This extension simplifies code readability by adding colorization to brackets in your code. It assigns distinct colors to matching pairs of brackets, parentheses, braces, and other code-delimiting characters, making it easy to identify which opening bracket corresponds to a closing one. This visual aid is particularly valuable in large and complex code files, as it reduces the risk of bracket-related errors and enhances code navigation.

   (f)**Code Spell Checker**-This extension checks your code for spelling errors, ensuring that variable names, comments, and documentation are correctly spelled. It’s especially useful in larger code bases to enhance code readability and maintain professionalism in your projects. By highlighting and suggesting corrections for spelling mistakes, it assists developers in creating well-documented and easily understandable code, promoting better code quality and collaboration.


6. Integrated Terminal:
   - Describe how to open and use the integrated terminal in VS Code. What are the advantages of using the integrated terminal compared to an external terminal?

 >Integrated Terminal in VS code can be opened in different ways such as follows
 (a)**Using Keyboard Shortcut**-The quickest way to open the terminal in VS Code on Windows is by using the keyboard shortcut:
 (Ctrl + ` :) Pressing Ctrl and the backtick key simultaneously opens the terminal

 (b)**Using Command Palette**-Another method is through the command palette:
Press Ctrl + Shift + P to open the command palette.
Type "toggle terminal" and press Enter to open the terminal

(c)**Using Right-Click Menu**- You can also access the terminal via the right-click menu within the workspace:
In the file explorer or editor, right-click on any file or empty space.
Select "Open in Integrated Terminal" to open the terminal in the current workspace.

The advantages of using integrated terminal over external terminal is that your session is persisted if you navigate throughout the Dashboard and return — letting you easily pick up where you left off. The integrated terminal also supports copy, paste, search, and session clearing.

7. File and Folder Management:
   - Explain how to create, open, and manage files and folders in VS Code. How can users navigate between different files and directories efficiently?
   How to create folder in visual code studio is by

   (a)By clicking the File > Add Folder to Workspace command brings up an Open Folder dialog to select the new folder and Once a root folder is added, the Explorer will show the new folder as a root in the File Explorer. You can right-click on any of the root folders and use the context menu to add or remove folders.

   (b)Drag and drop- You can use drag and drop to add folders to a workspace. Drag a folder to the File Explorer to add it to the current workspace. You can even select and drag multiple folders.

>*Note*: Dropping a single folder into the editor region of VS Code will still open the folder in single folder mode. If you drag and drop multiple folders into the editor region, a new multi-root workspace will be created.

  (c)command line --add:-Add a folder or multiple folders to the last active VS Code instance for a multi-root workspace.
     "code --add vscode vscode-docs"


8. Settings and Preferences:
   - Where can users find and customize settings in VS Code? Provide examples of how to change the theme, font size, and keybindings.

_HOW TO FIND CUSTOMIZE SETTINGS IN VS CODE_

**Step 8**: Start Debugging

Click on the "Play" button in the debug toolbar.
The program will run and pause at the specified breakpoints.
Use the debug controls in the sidebar to inspect variables, set watches, and step through the code.

10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.

    **Initialize a repository**-If your workspace is on your local machine, you can enable Git source control by creating a Git repository with the Initialize Repository command. When VS Code doesn't detect an existing Git repository, the Source Control view will give you the options to Initialize Repository or Publish to GitHub.

    **Making Commit**- Configure your Git username and email. When you commit, be aware that if your username and/or email is not set in your Git configuration,
     command for git username is "git config --global user.name "your username"
     command for git email is "git config --global email "your email"

   **pushing changes in github**-Before pushing changes, you should update your local branch to include any commits that have been added to the remote repository. If someone has made commits on the remote that are not on your local branch, GitHub Desktop will prompt you to fetch the new commits before pushing your changes to avoid merge conflicts.

   1. To push your local changes to the remote repository, in the repository bar, click Push origin.

   2. If there are commits on the remote branch that you don't have on your local branch, GitHub Desktop prompts you to fetch new commits from the remote. In the "New Commits on Remote" window, click Fetch.

   3. Optionally, click Preview Pull Request to open a preview dialog where you can review your changes and begin to create a pull request. For more information

   User can integrate Git with VsS code for version control by making sure that Git is installed in his/her computer in a latest version then integrate it with VS code by executing commands.
   You can create and checkout branches directly within VS Code through the Git: Create Branch and Git: Checkout to commands in the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P).

   If you run Git: Checkout to, you will see a dropdown list containing all of the branches or tags in the current repository. It will also give you the option to create a new branch if you decide that's a better option, or checkout a branch in detached mode.
